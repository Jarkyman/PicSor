# üì∑ PicSor ‚Äì Picture Sorter App

PicSor is an offline-first Flutter app that helps users clean and organize their local photo and video gallery through intuitive swiping.

Built for both Android and iOS, PicSor enables quick photo triage using left/right/up gestures, with undo history, soft-delete safety, sort-later mode, and detailed storage statistics. Everything runs locally with no backend, and monetization is handled via AdMob.
